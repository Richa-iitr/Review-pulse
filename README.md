## The Problem
User reviews play a crucial role in both web2 and web3 products and services, contributing to the success, trustworthiness and improvement of these offerings. Suppose you wish to buy a new mobile phone, wanna buy tickets for a new movie or wanna order a pizza from dominos, the first thing you look on as a user to the service is the customer reviews or ratings. Consider the following 2 products which one would you want to buy?

Product A with low price and low customer ratings or Product B with high price but good customer ratings.

Obviously, the second product will be more preferred despite the high price because of the assurance it provides. This is what the value of a review can be in the sale of a product and improvement of a service. On one side, the reviews add value to a product but there is no incentive for a user to add reviews. The problem revolves around the lack of sufficient incentives for users to provide honest and valuable reviews for products and services. Without proper motivation, users may not actively engage in the review process, leading to an incomplete or biased representation of the quality of products or services. Moreover, the absence of consequences for malicious reviews may undermine the trustworthiness of the entire review system.

**Challenges:**
- Limited User Participation: Users may be reluctant to spend time and effort in writing reviews without a clear incentive or benefit.
- Potential for Biased Reviews: Without proper checks and balances, there is a risk of receiving biased or fake reviews, which can mislead potential consumers.
- Trust Issues: Users might be skeptical about the authenticity of reviews, affecting their trust in the review system.
If there is some incentive for the user to provide honest reviews and punishments for the malicious providers, the review system can be more trustworthy and can add more value towards the improvement of the services.


## Solution

If we see the example of the Brave browser, how a decentralized ad-blocking service gained the traction of entire world by rewarding users for ad-blocks. This was when majority of people even came to know about blockchain technologies and the inherent workings and approaches,a step towards mass-adoption of web3 with a social goodness. We aim to solve the problem with a similar mindset for a mass adoption of blockchain technologies and consumer good, adding value to blockchain assets and technologies. 
Our approach incentivizes the users to provide reviews in a risk-and-reward model, the algorithm favors the true reviewers while punishing the malicious ones. The key focus areas of the model are:
- Preventing sybil attacks: with the use of ANON AADHAR for single user login and proof of personhood and citizenship. This ensures resistance to sybil attacks, allowing only one review per purchase by a person.
- Reward mechanism:
  - If we reward the users based on the majority, it might be a case that the users form a subgroup within themeselves to gain the maximum incentives. To prevent this, there would be several factors affecting the incentive model: users will be rewarded based on the risk they are taking (by reviewing first, or staking larger) and the consensus of the reviewers overall.
  - Now, the reviewers who are reviewing first take the maximum risk and must be rewarded the most and so likewise, however the future users may want to replicate the patterns in the review data sets provided previously. This may lead to malicious reviews. To overcome this we perform the incentive disbursal in rounds. Each round gets completed once a certain threshold of users has provided a review. 
  - The main point to note is that for a round the ratings and review provided by other users is completely hidden, however the users can still see the slight analysis of the product (safe or not) along with the descriptions of the previousreviewers, to decide whether or not to buys the product which will be determining the sale of the product.
  - Once a round is over the incentives for that round are available to be claimed, however to ensure the user taking the maximum risk is rewarded the most, the percentage of the pool rewards decreases with increasing rounds.
  - To ensure the protocol mechanics works as intended, there is a DAO of the highest reputated reviewers, currently declared on the basis of the Proof of Purchase NFTs with the users (not the best approach as of now but for actual product we can use game theory and reputation attestation for these tasks).  
- Whenever a service provider, publishes or posts his product, he decides a pool of native tokens which will be used as a reward for the review providers. 


 FUTURE 
 With the collaboration of service providers these incentives can include discounts, loyalty points, or other tangible benefits.
